Hi! This is my rendition of the classic game Brickbreaker. The point of brickbreaker is to keep the ball bouncing
within the game screen, avoiding having the ball touch the bottom of the screen. As the ball collides with the bricks
they dissapear and the user's score increases. Break as many bricks as possible to acheive the highest score.
